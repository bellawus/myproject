        Lee is a janitor who would seem to have no life desires or interests. He
        simply does his job and makes a living; he lives like a robot. He is
        like most people, except he is always alone, eats alone, walks alone,
        and has no emotions. Even though there are people who want to be a part
        of his life, he shows no interest, despite having a decent appearance
        and being quite charming. How could this be? It is necessary to go back
        a few years to his hometown, where he is a married man who lives happily
        with his wife and two children, brother, nephew and friends. But a
        terrible accident happened, and his children were killed in a fire. Lee
        has died since that time. He divorced and left his hometown, intending
        never to return to this gloomy and depressing place. But things have
        changed yet again. Lee's brother passed away and he wished he could
        adopt his son Patrick, but Lee refused. He returned to his hometown to
        handle his brother’s will. One day, he run into his ex-wife on the
        street, who is now remarried and pregnant. In my opinion, this is the
        most appealing (but sad) scene in the film. Although it was Lee's
        negligence that caused the accidents, but his ex-wife apologized him.
        Because she saw how miserable life Lee had been and he was stuck in the
        past, suffering from the pains. But she can move on because she is
        carrying new life, which allows her to have hope and joy again. As she
        knew she and Lee are the two people suffered this pain. Manchester by
        the Sea is a heartbreaking story about redemption and self-punishment.
        Some people believe that time heals most things, and that people can
        move on, but for some people, they cannot. The film is beautifully shot,
        with very delicate things/moments revealing the protagonist's past. The
        story is cold, disheartening, and desperate, but it appears that at the
        end, Lee makes some space for his life.

      <h2>Maudie movie review</h2>

        Maudie is a biological drama film directed by Aisling Walsh that is
        based on the true story of painter Maud Lewis, who lived in Nova Scotia,
        Canada. One of Canada's most beautiful coastlines, the film is shot in
        Nova Scotia, where Maud lives, with the ocean, the cottage, the flower,
        and the cat becoming the artist's major objects in her paintings. Maud
        is a disabled person with rheumatoid arthritis, which has limited her
        hand mobility. After her parents died, she lived with her aunt until she
        met Everett Lewis, a fish fishmonger, and the two married soon after.
        Maud began bringing her cards to sell in earnest when she went to the
        fish market with her husband; her husband encouraged her to paint; they
        lived in poverty, so she found anything she could paint on, on the
        window, on the wall, even on their house; she then became more
        reputable, and people came to buy her paintings. Her paintings are so
        vivid with bright colors and patterns, just like the beautiful scene in
        the movie, and these paintings are cheerful and colorful came from a
        little woman who is disabled and lives in poverty, which offer a
        nostalgic and optimistic vision of her life. Some of my favorite scenes
        from the film include her husband using the wheel cart to transport her
        and the background with the ocean. In addition, I appreciate how the
        movie depicts how she focused on drawing her paintings. The movie Maudie
        is brilliantly done and warmly acted by Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke.

      <h2>Paterson movie review</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 10px">

        Adam Driver, who is one of the best actors in recent years, stars in the
        Jim Jarmusch-directed film Paterson. The film is incredibly delicate,
        soft, and smooth; there are no major conflicts, no ups and downs, and no
        drama. It is about Paterson, a bus driver and poet who also resided in a
        Paterson-named town. The focus of the film was on Paterson's routine as
        a bus driver and his day-to-day life, but he is also a poet. Even the
        tiniest things can trigger his emotion, which inspired him to write a
        beautiful poem. He is constantly observing and paying attention to
        details in his life. He carried a notepad and a pen. One of the movie's
        more intriguing scenes has Paterson being able to overhear discussions
        in a bus while the cameras are focused on three different groups of
        people, including two young boys, two workers, and two college students.
        The director's focus on showing these scenes in the movies was very
        interesting; it not only explains to the audience where Paterson found
        the ideas and sources for his writing but also illustrates how we all
        live in a world like this, speaking and writing, fact and story, in
        everyday life; Paterson chose to write in the elegant words and
        sentences. Another interesting moment in the film is when it seems like
        there are twins of the elements everywhere; this took place after
        Paterson's girlfriend told him he had a dream about twins. I think
        that’s because since then he paid attention to the twins that’s why he
        felt like he has seen so many twins in town. I also think it is a way
        that the director staged the scene to reflect his imaginations. The film
        was a portrayal of beauty, with beautiful words and images.
